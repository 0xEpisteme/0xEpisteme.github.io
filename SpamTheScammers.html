  <p>After receiving an email which attempted to elicit user login information and billing information, I had the idea of filling up the scammer's database with fake mames and addresses to prevent them from knowing which ones are actually legitimate so they cannot use other people's information.</p>

  <p>This program generates and POSTs random names and addresses to a form.</p>
  <p>The fields may have to be modified depending on the form names. The range can also be altered to submit more or less forms..</p>
